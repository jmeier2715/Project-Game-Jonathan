Three Card Poker
    You are a player at the poker table with $200
    To initiate play you must ante (pay entry to see initial cards ex: $2)
    if ante is offered cards are dealt in sequence specified in wireframe
    first distribution is two cards to player, two cards to dealer
    player decides whether to bet more money or fold, consequentially forfeiting their ante money
    second distribution is four cards, one face down and three more in the community section
    The winner is the party with the better five card hand using the two dealt + the three community cards
    if the player wins, they receive a match of whatever they bet
    if the dealer wins, the player loses what they bet throughout the game

    the game ends when player runs out of money
